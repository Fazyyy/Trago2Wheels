The Mirage has the spirit of an adventure bike but is also perfect for urban city riding, thanks to the upside down forks, linked braking and single shock absorber at the rear. Its extremely efficient engine with 14 litre fuel tank and the option to add luggage boxes means that there is no limit to your adventures.
