A modern classic in a stylish cafe racer style, with low-mounted handlebars, cafe racer seat and elongated fuel tank which make the Cafe 125 look like it has been ridden straight out of a 1960's movie.

Now modernised, but retaining the original rebellious style of the Caf 125, this bike sports a 12-litre fuel tank and LED halo light with LED indicators.
